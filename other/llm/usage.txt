This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of government spending on education policies and their correlation with academic performance,
as indicated by scores from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Test (OSSLT).
By examining various countries' financial investments in their education systems, this study aims to identify patterns and outcomes that
highlight the effectiveness of these expenditures. Through a comparative approach, it assesses how different levels and methods of funding
impact student achievement in international benchmarks like PISA, which evaluates reading, mathematics, and science literacy among 15-year-olds,
and in specific contexts such as Ontario's literacy requirement, the OSSLT. This analysis seeks to offer valuable insights into the relationship
between educational funding and student performance, providing stakeholders with evidence-based recommendations for policy development and resource allocation.
